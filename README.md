## Hi there

I'm Gage, a software engineer based in USA!

Currently employed by Golf Genius working on one of their mobile apps, Golfshot.

My main technologis are Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Objective-C, XCode.

Currently in school for Masters of Computer Science at GATECH, expected graduation of DEC 26.

Fun Facts:
- I like anything ocean related(diving/fishing/etc), motorcycles, gym, gaming.
- I have two cats and one doberman.
- I'll never be satisfied with my neovim configuration.
